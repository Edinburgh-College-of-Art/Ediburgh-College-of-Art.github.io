You can program the micro:bit using any of the following

- [MakeCode Blocks](https://makecode.microbit.org)
- [Python](https://python.microbit.org/v/1.1)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

For Electronic Things we will be primarily using the Arduino IDE (i.e. C++) to program, For your own project, feel free to use whichever environment seems the most intuitive.

## Setting up Arduino IDE for micro:bit

There is a fairly [comprehensive guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino/overview) to setting up the micro:bit for use with the Arduino IDE at Adafruit's Website.

Follow the [instructions for blinking an LED](https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino/install-board-and-blink). should you have any problems, get in touch sooner rather than later.

### Hello World

To print out `Hello World` with Blocks, all you need to do is:

<pre id="pre1" class="makecode">
basic.showString("Hello World");
</pre>
