      <strong>Background:</strong>
      This short paper was written in 1999 in fulfillment of the 24-hour
      part of Stanford's Ph.D. <q>University Special Area Exams</q> and is
      hence somewhat cursory.  It was presented here with minor corrections
      in its original version in an attempt to make it accessible to the
      interested outside the departmental archives.  Thus, the code
      fragments given here pertain to the Common Music version current at
      that time, 1.3.  Please see the links above for updated versions of
      the code.  Also note that Rick Taube, the author of Common Music, has
      meanwhile reworked this paper into chapter 22 of his book
      <q>Notes from the Meta-Level: An Introduction to Computer
      Composition</q>, Swets &amp; Zeitlinger
      (in print).

    <h1>
     An Algorithmic Model of György Ligeti's Étude No. 1,
     <em>Désordre</em> (1985)
    </h1>


    <p>
     Probably inspired by its title, the first of György Ligeti's <q>Etudes
     for Piano</q> has been analyzed in great depth with respect to a
     perceived antagonism between chaos and order in the composition (<a href="#kinzler-91">Kinzler, 1991</a>).  However, while the study does
     discuss possible algorithms that Ligeti might have used during the
     compositional process, it exhibits a fervent musicological passion for
     infinitesimally minute details.  As a result, it largely fails to
     address matters related to the composition process and thus to explain
     Ligetis decisions from a perspective of <em>algorithmic control</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     The purpose of this paper is to arrive at some idea of what specific
     <q>knobs</q> the presumedly employed algorithms offered Ligeti and,
     hence, what compositorial potential they represent within the
     structural framework of the near-finished etude.  To accomplish this,
     the composition is first analyzed with what is believed to constitute
     reasonable neglect of accidental details and then <em>modeled</em> in
     the MIDI domain using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080220172441/http://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/doc/">Common Music</a> as a
     score description language.  As a model, it does make an honest attempt
     to be <q>realistic,</q> but also trades off accuracy against
     flexibility.  After all, there is no point in implementing an algorithm
     that cannot be <q>tossed around</q> in parameter-space!  The presumed
     algorithms are then discussed briefly with regard to their historical
     background.  Following that, hints are given for taking
     the model for a spin and generating general <em>désordre</em>.
    </p>

    <div class="nb">
     <p>
      A note regarding score references: since <q>Désordre</q> does largely
      away with synchronized barlines, references to the score need to be
      fully specified with page, system, and measure numbers—and,
      where necessary, an indication of the part.  In the following, this
      information will be given in shorthand notation as
     </p>

     <div class="syntax">
      <em>P</em>:<em>S</em>[<em>u</em>|<em>l</em>].<em>M</em>
     </div>

     <p>
      where <em>P</em>, <em>S</em>, and <em>M</em> denote page, system, and
      measure number, and—if necessary—<em>u</em> or <em>l</em>
      upper or lower part, respectively. Where systems begin with partial
      measures, the first complete measure is counted as measure 1.  All
      numbers follow the (only) facsimile edition (<a href="#ligeti-85">Ligeti, 1985</a>).
     </p>
    </div>



    <h2>Structure</h2>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
     The textural make-up of the etude is comparably straightforward in that
     each hand is assigned its own part, and that both parts share a common,
     layered substructure and a continuously pulsating eighth-note raster.
     Furthermore, each part is restricted to a <q>mode</q>—the right hand
     to <q>white</q> keys and the left hand to <q>black</q> keys.  As
     crudely keyboard-oriented and commonplace as this use of modality may
     seem, it actually presents a rather practicable choice that allows
     Ligeti to let both technically relatively difficult parts share a
     register where so desired.
    </p>

    <p>
     Aside from these common characteristics, the parts are temporally quite
     independent and follow their own processual logic.  That is, although
     stretches with near-synchronized phrase structures and prominent formal
     junctures exist, they are metrically and rhythmically independent when
     viewed on sub-formal levels.  This temporal independence is central to
     the composition in that, on a large scale, most of its form-defining
     features emerge from it.
    </p>

    <p>
     Internally, each part is a combination of continuously rising eighth
     note runs in the background and a rhythmically pronounced and slower
     melodic line in the foreground.  These foreground melodies are played
     <em>forte</em> throughout the piece and gain further prominence by
     progressing in increasingly dense chords—thus in effect establishing
     themselves as an autonomous layer against the eight-note background rather
     than relating to it as melodies to their accompaniment.  Yet, both
     foreground lines feature a phrase structure that is reminiscent of
     traditional melodic A A' B forms, where two closely related shorter
     phrases are followed by a longer and developing third phrase.  In
     addition, the phrasing hints, despite the distortion that is induced by
     an asymmetrical meter in each part, at an underlying simple and
     song-like two-beat meter.  A similarly asymmetric <q>meter</q> that is
     suggested in both background layers by eighth-note groups of differing
     lengths is relatively negligible compared to the prominent metric
     structure in the foreground layers.
    </p>

    <p>
     On a formal level, finally, the piece is structured by both, the
     temporal and pitch space-related behaviour of its two parts.  A first
     section, 404 eighth notes long, from the beginning of the piece to
     3:4.4, is mostly static in tempo, in spite of a small speed-up towards
     the end.  The following section, which extends for 231 eigth notes
     until 4:4.7, accelerates the foreground voices until their beat equals
     an eighth note.  At this point a typical <q>ligetiesque</q> cut
     interrupts the lower part, which had by then hit the bottom of the
     piano range, and resumes with both foreground lines in their original
     tempo and the lower part in the discant region, producing an aural
     effect of sudden slow-motion. This third section extends for the
     remaining 429 eigth notes to the end of the piece and is characterized
     by a static tempo in the upper part and a slowing down of the lower
     part.
    </p>


    <h3>The Data</h3>

    <p>
     Both foreground lines consist of cyclic repetitions of a constant step
     pattern (see <a href="#step-patterns">Figure 1</a>).  With each cycle,
     this pattern is transposed diatonically by a constant interval.  The
     pattern for the upper part consists of 26 steps, 7 for each of the A
     phrases and 12 for phrase B. The pattern for the lower part has 33
     steps, again 7 for each of the A phrases but this time 19 in the
     extended phrase B.
    </p>

    <div class="fig">
     <a name="step-patterns"><img src="/web/20080220172441im_/http://www.fictive.com/t/pbl/1999_desordre/step-patterns.gif" alt="step patterns"></a>
     <div class="fig-cap">
      <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Upper and lower part foreground step patterns.
     </div>
    </div>

    <p>
     Although these patterns bear a strong resemblance to material that has
     been generated by a rewrite system—a sequence of <q>generations</q>
     combined with an overall expanding gesture—they satisfy too many
     traditional musical criteria in order not to call for a standard
     musical description.
    </p>

    <p>
     The contours of both patterns are highly similar, and especially the
     upper part, which could have easily been generated by a
     context-sensitive grammar, exhibits strong motivic features.  In
     contrast to the lower part's pattern, whose B phrase extends by 2 bars
     beyond the expected 8 bars and ends in a <q>whole</q> note, however,
     the upper part's B phrase falls short by 2 bars and loops instantly
     back to its beginning.
    </p>

    <p>
     There are overall 14 cycles in the upper part, each of which is
     transposed <em>diatonically</em> one step upwards and, due to its
     greater length, only 11 cycles in the lower part.  The smaller number
     of cycles—which translates into fewer transpositions—is
     overcompensated for by a two-step diatonic transposition downwards and
     the fact that the lower part's pentatonic mode has fewer steps per
     octave than the heptatonic mode in the upper part.  The cycles align
     with the score as follows:

(1) Cycle 8 in the lower part reaches the bottom of the piano range
  and discontinues after m. 4 in phrase B only to resume immediately in the
  treble clef (4:4.7).  The first note of this continuation should read fs
  but for obvious reasons is given as fs5 to the right hand.
(2) Cycle is cut off after m. 3 in Phrase B.
(3) Cycle is cut off after m. 2 in Phrase A'.

     The rhythmic picture is less clear due to rasterization effects in the
     acceleration and deceleration of the patterns.  The sequence of rhythms
     in the upper and lower parts read as follows:

    <h2>The Model</h2>

    <p>
     This analysis translates fairly straightforward into a model of the
     combined foreground structure.  First, the tempo is set according to the
     specification in the score:
    </p>

    <pre class="codefrag"><span class="comment">;;;
;;; Tempo
;;;
;;; Set as ration in order to work around floating point rounding problems
;;; in cm timing.
</span>
(<span class="keyword">defparameter</span> <span class="function-name">*eigth-note-pulse*</span> (rationalize (rhythm 'e (tempo 76 w))))
    </pre>

    <p>
     This cosmetic hack allows calls to <tt>make-item-stream</tt> to be
     embedded in item stream constructor macros.
    </p>

    <pre class="codefrag"><span class="comment">;;;

</span>
(<span class="keyword">defprop</span> <span class="function-name">make-item-stream</span> <span class="constant">:item-expand</span> t)
    </pre>

    <p>
     Then an algorithm is defined for the upper foreground.  As suggested by
     the anaylsis above, the algorithm is driven by four sets of data: the
     part's mode, its step pattern, its transposition pattern, and its
     rhythmic pattern.

     The algorithm for the lower part foreground is driven by the same types
     of data.  However, since it is eventually <q>pitch-warped</q> into the
     treble clef after it hit the bottom of the keyboard (4:4.7), its
     transposition pattern adds a <q>warp</q> function that shifts notes 5
     octaves (i.e. 20 mode steps) up after 7 cycles, two 7-note phrases (A

    <p>
     The controls which this model offers over pitch structure and
     transposition factors are believed to be adequate to Ligeti's approach.
     The temporal processes, however, contain a fair amount of handcoding
     and are thus less easily transformed, although possibilities exist to
     replace them with more formal techniques.
