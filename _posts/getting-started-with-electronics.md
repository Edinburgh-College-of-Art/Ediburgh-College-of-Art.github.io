Here is a quick guide to getting started if you are interested in a project using electronics. Throughout the your time at ECA, should you have any questions about electronics or Arduino programming, get in touch with [Digital Development](mailto:DigiDevECA@ed.ac.uk?subject=Help!). Follow the setup below and bookmark this page for future reference.

## Setup

### Hardware

- **Arduino**

  To get started, first you are going to need an Arduino. Arduino UNOs are available at the [ECA bookit stores](https://bookit.eca.ed.ac.uk/av/) across campus.

- **Sensors**

  Sensor kits are also available from the [BookIt store](https://bookit.eca.ed.ac.uk/av/). As the semester progresses, you will need to look for sensor that can get the data you need. If you aren't sure which sensor you need, email [Digital Development](mailto:DigiDevECA@ed.ac.uk?subject=Help%20With%20Sensors&body=Hi,%0A%0AI%20Need%20X%20in%20order%20to%20do%20Y.%20Which%20sensor%20do%20I%20need?)

### Software

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc)

  To start programming the Arduino, you will need the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). There are tons of [tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage) available. It is also worth bookmarking the [Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Edinburgh-College-of-Art/arduino-examples)

  The GitHub repository contains a documentation and example for the Arduino Uno kits available on bookit. [Download the Repository](https://github.com/Edinburgh-College-of-Art/arduino-examples/archive/master.zip) or [Sign-up for GitHub](https://github.com), download the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com). Git is a great way to manage your code especially if you need help debugging.

  If you don't want to sign-up for Github, you can simply clone the repository using git in command line. If you want to start using git, [follow the git setup guide](#Git-Windows).

## Resources

### Arduino

- [Arduino Tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage)
- [Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)

### Re-Use

We would encourage you to use waste materials as much as possible. There are all manner of components to be stripped out of old electronic equipment such as buttons, sliders, knobs and so forth.

Check out the [Free-Use Hub](https://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/facility/free-use-hub) at the Firestation for some interesting finds.

### Where to Buy Components

If you absolutely must buy some sensor or components, the the following are reputable suppliers that deal in RoHS compliant materials. Of course, it never hurts to [ask if we have something already.](mailto:DigiDevECA@ed.ac.uk?Subject=Sensors&Body=Hi%2C%0A%0ADo%20you%20have%20X%20I%20can%20beg%2C%20borrow%20or%20steal%3F)

### Where can I work with Electronics?

If you want to go beyond using a breadboard and need some workshop space there are some facilities available in the University and the wider city of Edinburgh. We wouldn't encourage students to use there own soldering irons, so there are some facilities available on request.

- [uCreate Studio](https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk)
- [Design Informatics](https://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/profile/mark-kobine)

Out of hours and outside the university there are some facilities available for electronic prototyping

- [Edinburgh HackLab](https://edinburghhacklab.com)
- [Eagle Lab at CodeBase](https://labs.uk.barclays/locations/edinburgh)

### Courses

There are a few courses in ECA that deal with the Arduino platform and electronics in design. If you have an elective you can take this courser, otherwise contact the course organiser if you would like to audit a course.

- [Electronic Things](https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/DESI08084_SV1_SEM2)

  An introduction to the design of products that use electronics and software to sense and respond to their environment. Great for an overall introduction to creative applications to Arduino development.

- [Connected Things](https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/DESI10057_SV1_SEM2)

  An introduction to the design of products alongside the streaming of live qualitative and quantitative data from social and technical settings. this course uses Arduino like devices for connecting to and and utilising data streams in real-time.

- [Histories and Futures of Technology](https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/DESI11073_SS1_SEM1)

  This course addresses key historical and contemporary developments across digital media. First part of the course involves making a _data probe_ using Arduino.

- [Digital Media Studio Project](https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/ARCH11006_SV1_SEM2)

  This course does not directly deal with Arduino development, but is a great opportunity to apply creative applications of electronics in a groups project.
